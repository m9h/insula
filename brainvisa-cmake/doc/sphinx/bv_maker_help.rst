Usage: bv_maker [options] [ command [command options] ]...

This program is for the management of source retrieval, configuration and compilation of BrainVISA projects.

In order to work, the commands svn and svnadmin must be installed on your system. On some Linux systems they are in two separate packages (e.g. subversion and subversion-tools).

Commands:

* info: Just output info about configured components.
* sources: Create or updated selected sources directories from Subversion
  repository.
* configure: Create and configure selected build directories with CMake.
* build: compile all selected build directories.
* doc: Generate documentation (sphinx, doxygen, docbook, epydoc).
* testref: Execute tests in a special mode to generate machine-specific
  reference files (this is needed by some tests).
* test: Execute tests using ctest.
* pack: Generate binary packages.
* install_pack: Install binary packages.
* testref_pack: Create the machine-specific reference files for tests in
  installed binary package.
* test_pack: Run tests in installed binary packages.
* publish_pack: Publish binary packages.

To get help for a specific command, use -h option of the command. Example: "bv_maker build -h".

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -d DIR, --directory=DIR
                        Restrict actions to a selected directory. May be used
                        several times to process several directories.
  -c CONFIG, --config=CONFIG
                        specify configuration file. Default
                        ="/home/dr144257/.brainvisa/bv_maker.cfg"
  -s DIR, --sources=DIR
                        directory containing sources
  -b DIR, --build=DIR   build directory
  --username=USERNAME   specify user login to use with the svn server
  -e, --email           Use email notification (if configured in the general
                        section of the configuration file)
  --disable-jenkins     disable Jenkins server logging
  --def, --only-if-default
                        apply only steps which are defined as default steps in
                        the bv_maker.cfg config file. Equivalent to passing
                        --only-if-default to every substep which supports it.
  -v, --verbose         show as much information as possible
  --version             show bv_maker (brainvisa-cmake) version number
